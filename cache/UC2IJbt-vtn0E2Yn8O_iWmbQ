BACKSTORY:
Six years ago, the students at OMF were inspired by Slipknot's &quot;Duality&quot; video and decided that they would record the song and film it...house destruction and all!  They then followed that up with &quot;The Devil in I&quot;, &quot;Before I Forget&quot; and now this in 2020.  But after flipping a car over and setting it on fire, using a 50 foot tree as a battering ram, tearing off a garage door with a truck and having far too many conversations with the local police, this is it.  The last OMF house destruction video!   As with any OMF project there is a lot of hard work that goes on behind the scenes.  With &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; it started with 6 students from around the U.S. spending countless hours practicing and reinterpreting the song.  For example, Seb Braganza wrote an entire solo section that does not exist in the original song!  The OMF crew had nearly 30 kids from around the country in town that weekend and this was just one of 7 songs that the crew had to film in only 15 hours cuz' at midnight the police stopped us due to noise ordinance violations.  Normally, accomplishing this much would be impossible, but as long as you have an army of amazing volunteers and some of the most talented young musicians in the country,  it's a piece of cake :)  

And since this was recorded and filmed in 2020, OMF had to institute our over-the-top COVID precautions which you can learn more about here: https://okmusicfoundation.org/omf-covid-19-precautions/

A note from Mackenzie:
&quot;I would like to thank Dr. Tianshu Wang for her incredible piano instruction. In just over a month, she has greatly refined my piano skills after a several year hiatus in formal lessons. I would also like to thank OMF for giving me the opportunity to record in such a professional setting, as well as Rick Humphreys (perhaps most of all) for being my first piano teacher, and leading me to my love for making music.

BACKSTORY:
Recorded entirely in a garage, the kids' rendition of &quot;Blind&quot; by Korn proves that you don't need a fancy studio when the band is composed of 5 insanely talented kids from around the country!  And since this was recorded during the height of the pandemic, OMF instituted our crazy, over-the-top COVID precautions.  Unmasked singer in a quarantine cage? Check.  Gas masks? Check. Kids playing hopscotch in Tyvek chemical suits? Check.  As always, OMF would like to thank the crew.  And of course a big thanks to our donors who made this recording and video completely FREE for the kids üôè  To music lovers everywhere, please consider donating to OMF so kids from around the country can PLAY. REAL. MUSIC.

A note from Mackenzie:
&quot;I would like to thank Dr. Tianshu Wang for her incredible piano instruction. In just over a month, she has greatly refined my piano skills after a several year hiatus in formal lessons. I would also like to thank OMF for giving me the opportunity to record in such a professional setting, as well as Rick Humphreys (perhaps most of all) for being my first piano teacher, and leading me to my love for making music.

BACKSTORY:
A Drowning Pool cover has always been high on our list.  So when the stars aligned the kids jumped at the chance to cover &quot;Bodies&quot;.  Prodigies from Iowa, Michigan, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio came together to bring this cover to life!   Aidan Fisher then wrote a guitar solo for &quot;Bodies&quot; which was inspired by the late Edward Van Halen who passed away on October 6th, 2020.  A huge, tremendous thanks to all the kids for absolutely crushing this song and making it their own ü§ü  And of course a big thanks to our donors who made this recording and video completely FREE for the kids üôè  To music lovers everywhere, please consider donating to OMF so kids from around the country can PLAY. REAL. MUSIC.

A note from Mackenzie:
&quot;I would like to thank Dr. Tianshu Wang for her incredible piano instruction. In just over a month, she has greatly refined my piano skills after a several year hiatus in formal lessons. I would also like to thank OMF for giving me the opportunity to record in such a professional setting, as well as Rick Humphreys (perhaps most of all) for being my first piano teacher, and leading me to my love for making music.

BACKSTORY:
Can a 6 year old boy do justice to a Korn song??  A year ago, I'd say probably not.  But then we met Michael Dalhover.  Both of his parents are HUGE Korn fans, so Michael has been singing Korn songs and attending Korn concerts from an even earlier age.  Simply put, Michael was born to sing Korn!  Recorded entirely in a garage, the kids' rendition of &quot;Here To Stay&quot; proves that you don't need a fancy studio when the band is composed of 5 insanely talented kids from around the country!  Hailing from Tennessee, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio, this supergroup absolutely Krushed this Korn Klassic ü§ü  As always, OMF would like to thank the crew.  And of course a big thanks to our donors who made this recording and video completely FREE for the kids üôè  To music lovers everywhere, please consider donating to OMF so kids from around the country can PLAY. REAL. MUSIC.

MUSICIANS:
Vocals / Taylor Jade Campbell / Age 8 Instagram @taylorjadecampbellmusic
Drums / Olivia A / Age 9
Bass / Jonas Miller / Age 15
Lead Guitar / John Fowler  / Age 16 /  https://www.facebook.com/john.fowler.3762

BACKSTORY
As with any OMF project there is a lot of hard work that goes on behind the scenes.  Olivia, the drummer, spent nearly a year working on the song and learning to play along with a metronome...which is not an easy skill for any musician, much less a 9 year old!  John Fowler, lead guitarist and life long Pantera fan, played the song note for note and strived for absolute perfection.  Jonas Miller was then on hand to lay down a solid bass line and groove.  Finally, Taylor Campbell brought her own unique interpretation to the song and helped create a performance that is one-of-a-kind!  Be sure to watch the other 2 OMF versions of &quot;Walk&quot; by Pantera to see how other students tackled this masterpiece.

BACKSTORY:
Recorded entirely in a garage, the kids' rendition of &quot;Roots Bloody Roots&quot; by Sepultura proves that you don't need a fancy studio when the band is composed of 7 insanely talented kids from around the country!  Hailing from Texas, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Ohio, this supergroup put their own spin on the song.  Check out the guitar solo that Seb Braganza improvised on the spot!  Or Sebastian James' 55 gallon metal drum solo, also improvised!  As always, OMF would like to thank the crew.  And of course a big thanks to our donors who made this recording and video completely FREE for the kids üôè  To music lovers everywhere, please consider donating to OMF so kids from around the country can PLAY. REAL. MUSIC.
