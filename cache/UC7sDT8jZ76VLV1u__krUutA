More About &quot;Swipe Up, Vivian!&quot;:
Agoraphobic, sad, and all over the place, Vivian hasn't left her apartment since a nuclear bomb went off four years ago half way across the world. She lives in her own filth and doesn't talk to anyone -- much to her sister's chagrin. But after a near-death experience, Vivian decides to sign up for a virtual dating app for agoraphobes -- BLISS. There, she meets &quot;cool-girl&quot; Katrina, who seems a little too good to be true. Will Vivian be able to break out of her terrible habits, or will she be doomed to living in her own filth forever? Swipe Up, Vivian! is an accidentally prescient film made before the pandemic that is definitely not the pandemic. The creators swear they are not psychic.

Two lonely romantics go to absurd lengths to be anyone but themselves.

More About &quot;Vessel&quot;:
Thomas and Lucy are on a date. It’s going well. Really well. The chemistry is palpable - there is never a dull moment, never a lull in conversation. These two seem perfect for each other. Thomas waxes poetic on T.S. Elliot’s prose, Lucy recites her favourite stanzas… They are the envy of every couple in the restaurant. But if these jealous couples just looked a little closer, beyond the big words and fancy clothes, they would find something very peculiar. Unbeknownst to each other and other restaurant patrons, Thomas and Lucy each sport a discreet earpiece. And, through their respective earpieces, these “passionate” and “soulful” “lovers’’ are being told exactly what to do and say...

Yes, relationships are without a doubt exhausting and anxiety-provoking, but what if there were a service that could all but assure success on date night? And every date after that? VESSEL tracks Thomas and Lucy's relationship, from first day to the alter, taking viewers to an alternate reality, where some inhabitants submit themselves to an enigmatic “Operating Service” that controls the entirety of their romantic lives.

More About &quot;Penumbra&quot;:
Something's wrong with Fae. She's been going missing without explanation, winding up in a recovery center. Her younger sister, Dori, is worried. Is Fae schizophrenic? Is there really someone stalking her?  She sneaks a look at Fae's diary, and what she sees is disturbing: a drawing of something monstrous, made of shadows and tentacles. Suddenly, the lights start to fail. There's something coming for Fae, but Dori soon discovers that whatever it is – it's not of this world. As objects begin levitating and Fae is pulled into the sky by an unseen force, Dori risks everything to save her.

More about &quot;Jeff Drives You&quot;:
David is a sad, lonely gay man plagued by relationships past. In a random turn of events, he wins a spot in the &quot;Jeff Fleet Beta Test,&quot; an self-driving car program meant for long journeys. At first, Jeff, the bumbling AI can't get David's attention. But once David's phone dies, the two realize they have a lot more in common than they thought. Jeff Drives You is a strange strange film about the cyclical nature of relationships, and the baggage we carry with us from one to the next.

Izumi Ishimoto and Alex Morales were once in love and now cannot forget each other twenty years later. Now 20 years have passed and they have moved on with their lives, but so has the world. Set in a boring and bureaucratic version of NYC, Izumi and Alex go about their mundane existences while quietly refusing to give into mandates of the new dystopian society – namely undergoing a surgical treatment that renders the brain incapable of dreaming. A mysterious company called the Sandman Corp., led by the equally enigmatic Dr. Esperanza Haddid, who boldly claims to have developed a technology to create alternate realities or dreams by scanning people’s’ memories. The opportunity to reconnect with each other is a temptation the two haven’t felt in years.
