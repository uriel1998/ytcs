   <media:description>Horses are overrated. 

For thousands of years, humans have lived in harmony with horses as we’ve domesticated and used these gigantic animals for a variety of purposes. But are they outdated, inconvenient, resource sinks? Our symbiotic relationship with horses ends today as Helen Floersh defames horses once and for all on Hot Take.

How do documentaries avoid the Tiger King trap?

Documentary films almost inevitably raise ethical questions about what it means to film real life people, and Tiger King was certainly no exception. But it had us thinking: If Tiger King has proven particularly ethically-troublesome to so many critics then... what makes a documentary ethical in the first place? Let's examine in this Wisecrack Edition on What Makes a Documentary Ethical (Or Not)?
